In this short tutorial I'll walk you through how you can create an easy and quick (very simple) blog website for publishing your articles using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## What is Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a production ready open source [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework that allows quick generation of both static and dynamic websites using [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/). It provides functionalities like Pre-rendering, both SSG (Static Site Generation) and SSR (Server Side Rendering), hybrid SSG & SSR, Client-side routing, API routes, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support to name a few.

## What is Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a plain text formatting syntax, used to add formatting capabilities to plain text documents.

## Creating Next.js project

To create a Next.js application, open the terminal and just run the following command:


After, you should have a folder called `nextjs-markdown-blog`.

Execute the following commands


And development server starts on port 3000 by default. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) from your browser and you should see the following:

<Image
  src='/images/2020-10-22-nextjs-markdown-blog/developmentserver.png'
  alt='Next.js Development Server Running'
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

If you see the previous window, the starter template page, it means everything went smoothly and we are ready to proceed!

## Next.js Application folder structure

  alt='Next.js Folder Structure'
  width={222}
  height={335}
/>

You should have the above folder structure. I'll not enter into details about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) folder structure and routing since it is not on the scope of this tutorial, but you can check the official documentation [here](https://nextjs.org/).

To keep the simplicity of this article and focus on what is presented, you can delete folders `styles` and `api` under `pages`.

Also, delete the first line of `_app.js`:


That's should do it for now.

## Starting Blog implementation

Let's start by creating a `site.config.json` file in the root folder, so we have a unique place for website global configuration without hardcoding values on each file. On it, place the following code:


Now, go to index.js and type the following code, replacing the existing one:


You should now see on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

<Image
  src='/images/2020-10-22-nextjs-markdown-blog/app1screen.png'
  alt='First Screen'
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

Let's now add a little bit of page customization using layouts, but first, let me briefly explain how [Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) works on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):

As stated in the beginning of the article, we can have two types of pre-rendering, Static Generation or Server Side Rendering. Basically we have three methods for fetching data for pre-rendering:

- **_Static Generation using_**
  - getStaticProps: for fetching data at build time
  - getStaticPaths: for defining paths / routes to pre-render based on data
- **_Server Side Rendering using_**
  - getServerSideProps: for fetching data on each request

Let's then, using Static Generation strategy for our blog, inject previously defined site configurations into the page. Add the following code to `index.js`


This should be what we see when we navigate to our index page now:

<Image
  src='/images/2020-10-22-nextjs-markdown-blog/app2screen.png'
  alt='Second Screen'
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

## Adding Blog template components

We will create a new folder in the root of the project called `components`. Inside we will create 3 files `Footer.js`, `Header.js` and `Layout.js`.
